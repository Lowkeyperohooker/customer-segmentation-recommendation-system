# Customer Segmentation Recommendation System

This project focuses on segmenting customers and providing personalized recommendations using a machine learning approach.

## Usage
You can run this project seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces. Follow these steps to set up and run the system:

1. **Install Requirements**
   Run the `install_requirements.py` script to install all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   python install_requirements.py
   ```

2. **Set Up Jupyter Kernel**
   Run the `setup_kernels.py` script to configure the Jupyter notebook kernel:
   ```bash
   python setup_kernels.py
   ```

3. **Commit Changes to Main**
   Use the `commit_to_main.sh` script to stage, commit, and push changes to the main branch:
   ```bash
   ./commit_to_main.sh
   ```

4. **Install Git LFS**
   Finally, set up Git Large File Storage (LFS) by running the `install_git_lfs.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./install_git_lfs.sh
   ```

Once these steps are completed, you can begin using the system for customer segmentation and recommendations.

## Notes
- Ensure that Git LFS is properly installed before working with large files like `data.csv`.
- For troubleshooting, refer to the detailed README sections or contact the repository maintainer.
